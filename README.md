# CherryTI

## Overview
Homebrew framework using PHP

## Requirement
- PHP
- MySQL

## Usage
The reason why I made this self-made framework this time is that I want more people to develop my own framework. The reason is that by creating a framework from scratch, you have a much better understanding of the framework you have been using. I think that it is rare to know the contents during development. So why don't you take this opportunity to use your own framework?
The name is Cherry TI.

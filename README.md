## Overview
Homebrew framework using PHP

## Requirement
- PHP
- MySQL

## Usage
Why don't you play with the lightweight framework and play around with it?

The reason why I made this framework this time is that I want more people to develop the framework. The reason is that by creating a framework from scratch, you have a much better understanding of the framework you have been using. I think that it is rare to know the contents during development. So why don't you take this opportunity to use the framework?
The name is Cherry TI.

If you have any concerns, please raise an issue. Also, please do more and more pull requests. I'm so happy that I'm very welcome.
